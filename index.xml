      <description>Built a model that predicts whether a customer will stop their subscription or not Data was sourced from kaggle dataset. Performed data cleaning and data transformation to enable the data to be ready for excellent analysis Models employed: Random Forest, SVM, Linear Model and Decision Tree. Random Forest performed best with an accuracy result of 95%. Though not extremely good in the medical field but can be improved on. Skills employed include Python, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Logistics Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Trees Classifier.</description>
